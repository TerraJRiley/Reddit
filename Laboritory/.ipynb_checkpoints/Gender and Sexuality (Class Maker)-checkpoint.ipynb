    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "How many times have you opened up a browser for a random subreddit only to find that it wasn't the random subreddit you were looking for?  We've all been there.  Furthermore, what about when you wonder \"golly, just how similar are different subreddits that are focused one concept but from entirely different points of view?\"  Well, we hear you.  We've scrapped data from two active subreddits which focus around sexuality and using them build a model that's able to detect if it's one subreddit or the other with over an 80% certainty.  Furthermore, if future exploritory data analysis, we hope to one day be able to talk about the defining features of each subculter that's being represented by these subreddits."
